        <h2>HOW WALNUTS ARE IMPORTANT TO UNSW</h2>
        There are three main types of walnuts found in Sydney:
        <ul>
          <li>Red walnuts; and</li>
          <li>Non-red walnuts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Walnuts really can't be oversimplified in terms of how they ' re eaten. It's actually very simple. You grab
          one, you place it on your mouth, you swallow, you smile, everyone is
          happy.</p>

      <h2>NUT REGIONS</h2>
      <p>At UNSW, nuts are grown anywhere that food can also be found. In particular, food courts.</p>
      <p>It's important to understand that walnuts have a lot in common with other kinds of nuts and their respective regions
        too.</p>
